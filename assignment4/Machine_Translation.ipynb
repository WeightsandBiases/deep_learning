    "[Multi30K](https://github.com/multi30k/dataset) is a dataset for machine translation tasks. It is a multilingual corpus containing English sentences and their German translation. In total it contains 31014 sentences(29000 for training, 1014 for validation, and 1000 for testing).\n",

    "[TorchText](https://github.com/pytorch/text) is a PyTorch package that consists of data processing utilities and popular datasets for natural language. The key idea of TorchText is that datasets can be organized in *Field*, *TranslationDataset*, and *BucketIterator* classes. They serve to help with data splitting and loading, token encoding, sequence padding, etc. You don't need to know about how TorchText works in detail, but you might want to know about why those classes are needed and what operations are necessary for machine translation. This knowledge can be migrated to all sequential data modeling. In the following parts, we will provide you with some code to help you understand.\n",

    " You can refer to torchtext's documentation(v0.9.0) [here](https://pytorch.org/text/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spacy\n",
    "Spacy is package designed for tokenization in many languages. Tokenization is a process of splitting raw text data into lists of tokens that can be further processed. Since TorchText only provides tokenizer for English, we will be using Spacy for our assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
